# KCC - The Kayte C Compiler

KCC is a simple, modular C/Objective-C compiler written from scratch in C. It is designed to be a learning tool for understanding the entire compilation pipeline, from preprocessing and tokenization to parsing, abstract syntax tree (AST) generation, and final assembly code generation.

The compiler is cross-platform and can generate native assembly for both Apple Silicon (ARM64) and Intel/AMD (x86-64) architectures, with growing support for Objective-C language features and comprehensive array support.

## Current Status & Features

The compiler is functional and can compile a substantial subset of the C language with experimental Objective-C support and comprehensive array functionality.

### Core Compiler Features

âœ… **Cross-Platform Code Generation**: Automatically generates optimized assembly for ARM64 and x86-64 architectures with native CPU optimizations.

âœ… **Complete Frontend**: Includes a robust preprocessor, enhanced lexer, and recursive descent parser.

âœ… **AST Generation**: Builds a comprehensive Abstract Syntax Tree to represent source code structures.

âœ… **Symbol Table**: Advanced implementation supporting variable scoping, function signatures, and complex type tracking.

âœ… **Control Flow**: Supports if/else, while, and for statements with proper code generation.

âœ… **Expressions**: Handles arithmetic, comparison, logical, and unary operators with correct precedence.

âœ… **Variables & Functions**: Full support for declarations, assignments, parameter passing, and function calls.

## Quick Start & Build Instructions

To build the compiler, you will need a C compiler (like Clang or GCC) and CMake 3.16 or later.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
# git clone https://www.github.com/ringsce/kcc.git
# cd kcc

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# 3. Configure the project with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# 4. Compile the project
make

# 5. Run tests (if available)
make test_all
```

This will create the `kcc` executable inside the build directory with optimizations enabled for your target architecture.

## Usage

You can use the KCC compiler from the command line with various options.

```bash
# Compile a simple C program and create an executable named 'a.out'
./kcc ../examples/test.c

# Compile an Objective-C program
./kcc ../examples/test.m

# Compile with array runtime support
./kcc -arrays ../examples/array_test.c

# Specify an output file name
./kcc ../examples/test.c -o my_program

# Enable verbose output to see compilation stages
./kcc -v ../examples/test.c

# Enable debug mode to print tokens and the AST
./kcc -d ../examples/test.c

# Run the preprocessor only and print to standard output
./kcc -E ../examples/test.c

# Enable bounds checking for arrays (debug builds)
./kcc -bounds-check ../examples/array_program.c
```

## Example Programs

### C Example with Arrays

Create a file named `array_test.c`:

```c
// array_test.c
#include <stdio.h>
#define SIZE 5

int main() {
    // Static array declaration
    int numbers[SIZE] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int matrix[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
    
    // Array access and manipulation
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        numbers[i] *= 2;
        printf("numbers[%d] = %d\n", i, numbers[i]);
    }
    
    // Pointer arithmetic
    int *ptr = &numbers[0];
    *(ptr + 1) = 100;  // Equivalent to numbers[1] = 100
    
    // Multi-dimensional array access
    printf("matrix[1][2] = %d\n", matrix[1][2]);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced C Example with Structures

```c
// struct_test.c
typedef struct {
    int x, y;
    char name[20];
} Point;

union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[4];
};

enum Color {
    RED = 1,
    GREEN,
    BLUE
};

int main() {
    Point points[3] = {
        {0, 0, "Origin"},
        {10, 20, "Point1"}, 
        {30, 40, "Point2"}
    };
    
    union Data data;
    data.i = 42;
    
    enum Color favorite = BLUE;
    
    // Access struct members
    points[1].x = 15;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Objective-C Example

Create a file named `test.m`:

```c
// test.m
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Calculator : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;
- (int)add:(int)a to:(int)b;
@end

@implementation Calculator
@synthesize name;

- (int)add:(int)a to:(int)b {
    return a + b;
}
@end

int main() {
    Calculator *calc = [[Calculator alloc] init];
    calc.name = @"MyCalculator";
    
    int result = [calc add:5 to:3];
    
    if (result == 8) {
        return 0;  // Success
    }
    return 1;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
# Compile the program
./kcc array_test.c -o array_program

# Run the compiled executable
./array_program

# Check the exit code (should be 0 for this example)
echo $?
```
